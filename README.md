Collection of SQL, PHP, HTML, JavaScript, and Google Apps Scripts related to the method of creating custom APIs into the III Sierra database.

Some the files presented here those discussed at the September 18, 2015 Eastern Great Lakes Innovative Users Group Conference. I am including the HTML-based presentation as well for a reference.
